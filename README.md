# mtk

Music Software Toolkit is designed to be a low level way of creating musical
scores as well as produce and mix music.

The creation of musical scores is based on the MusicXML spec. All audible output
is in WAV format.

The goal of the project is to allow the representation of a piece of music in
the form of a rust program. The API provided is also intended to be used as a
lower level component in other programs. Generally, the content of mtk is a low
level representation of as music theory, music representation/arrangement,
instrument modelling, and music production/mixing/mastering/processing.
